        Ajax content loaded from file
    </p>

    <p>
        Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous
        Javascript and XML. It is used to
        communicate with the server without
        refreshing the web page and thus
        increasing the user experience and
        better. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
        etc are considered the situation when
        check news feed and if like someone
        post simply click the like button and
        the like count is added without
        refreshing the page. Now imagine the
        situation if there would be the case,
        click the like button and the complete
        page would be loaded again which will
        make such processes.
